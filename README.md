## 🛠️ **Getting Started**

### 🔧 **Backend Setup**

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** in the backend directory with the following variables:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
   ```

4. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

The backend will be running on `http://localhost:5000` 🚀

### 🎨 **Frontend Setup**

## 🤖 **AI Usage in Development**

This project was developed with extensive assistance from **Cursor's AI assistant** 🤖, which served as an invaluable co-pilot throughout the entire development process. The AI was instrumental in **rapid scaffolding**, generating boilerplate code for Express routes, controllers, and React components, significantly accelerating the initial setup phase. For **complex logic implementation**, the AI provided crucial assistance with core features like JWT authentication flows, password hashing with bcrypt, Redux async thunks for state management, and file upload handling with Multer and Cloudinary integration. As a **debugging partner**, the AI quickly identified and fixed bugs ranging from backend server errors to frontend UI issues, including resolving production build errors and deployment challenges. Beyond coding, the AI acted as a **learning and refactoring mentor**, explaining new concepts, suggesting code improvements, and ensuring the project followed industry best practices. This collaborative approach with AI not only made development faster but also more educational, providing insights into modern web development patterns and techniques that enhanced the overall quality of the codebase.
